# MathWhiteBoard
A repo for my rough whiteboard math notes for my math research. I am trying to model mathematical expressions with graphs and therein import the notion of algebraic normalization.

## Presentation
Here are my graphs that I have produced so far. Each relatively similar in presentation with a modest change iterated to test out the formalisms.

### Goal
The intention for this repo is to contain successively more and more abstract iterations on the same concept. I will reduce the graphs down to what I see as to pertaining to what I see as the essential characteristic circumscribing the algebraic relationships I wish to model. Thus, expect every iteration to be a little more abstract than the last.
