# MathWhiteBoard
A repo for my rough whiteboard math notes for my math research. I am trying to model mathematical expressions with graphs and therein import the notion of algebraic normalization.

## Presentation
Here are my graphs that I have produced so far. Each relatively similar in presentation with a modest change iterated to test out the formalisms.
